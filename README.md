# D3-Tree-Map-for-fCC

This is a tree map that displays the top 100 highest grossing movies, grouped by genre.
When you point on any given rectangle, a tooltip will display the name of the movie, its genre, and its value in dollars.

I learnt about d3.hierarchy() and d3.sum(), d3.treemap(), and Intl.NumberFormat('en-US').

This is the last project that got me my data visualization certificate, yeehoo !
